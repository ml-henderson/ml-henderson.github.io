Healthcare has a large environmental footprint due to unique aspects stemming from human health and safety requirements; however, negative environmental impact is itself worsening human health. This feedback loop is explored using a system model to encompass the influence of individual and societal decisions on the health-healthcare-environment system. Using Meadowsâ€™ System Leverage Points, healthcare interventions to reverse the damaging cycle are recommended including: embracing a holistic view of health; explicitly including environmental health as a goal of healthcare; compensating for health outcomes rather than treatments; and improving information flows on the health impacts of individual and social decisions. These changes can act on both environmental and human health, shifting to a beneficial feedback loop between healthcare, health, and the environment.
