Inequality and Sustainability Transitions (for Theories of Sustainable Transitions class)

Why is inequality related to environmental destruction, and how does considering inequality clarify understanding of sustainability transitions? This paper will explore first how domestic inequality in developed countries helps explain the causes of environmental degradation through unequal influence on governance and managing common pool resources. Second, it will review who is disproportionately affected by poor environmental quality as a result of poor governance. Next, it proposes that understanding inequalityâ€™s effects inequality demonstrates solutions to the environmental crisis through improving equality efforts in national governance. Finally, it will counter arguments that inequality has a beneficial environmental effect and concludes that addressing inequality is an important component to enacting sustainability transitions in domestic governance in developed countries.
