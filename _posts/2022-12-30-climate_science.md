Two extended abstracts on two important climate topics, methane and land based mitigations.

Key definitions for the following:
* Albedo = the reflectivity of a surface (white reflects more --> higher albedo)
* Troposphere = the layer of atmosphere closest to earth
* Stratosphere = the layer of atmosphere above the troposphere, where the good ozone lives
* Aerosols = particles of air pollution (soot, ash, sulfur dioxide, etc.)
* Biomass = biogenic stuff, usually plant matter
