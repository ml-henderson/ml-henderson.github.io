Commercial shipping is responsible for a large portion of global emissions, underwater noise pollution, and deadly collisions with marine life. To achieve Sustainable Development Goals 14 and 13, short-term interventions are needed while new technologies develop. Slowing ship speed can have a high impact on emissions and safety for marine life (reductions of 13-33% greenhouse gases, 50-70% strike lethality, 40%-80% noise). MEPC 80 is recommended to adopt mandatory global speed limit of 10 knots for large commercial vessels, conduct stakeholder analysis to determine limits for other vessels, and enable flag and port states to enforce with remote monitoring and fines.
