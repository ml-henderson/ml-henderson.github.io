A reduction in livestock production and consumption is critical for the sustainability transition in the UK, but there are no explicit policies towards this goal.Current policies provide some support towards a diet and farming shift but do not have specific measures to capitalize on current trends of reducing animal product consumption. Three recommended policies will utilize leverage points to create a positive tipping point away from animal consumption and production:
* Public procurement of plant-based foods to increase demand and shift social norms.
* New agricultural subsidies for conversion away from livestock farming to build on current nature restoration schemes.
* A gradually increasing animal product consumption tax to create cost-parity with plant-based alternatives and unsustainable animal products.
