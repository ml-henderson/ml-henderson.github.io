## Academic Abstract
Resilience, or the ability to quickly recover from shocks, is a critical quality for natural and social systems in the face of climate change which is increasing the frequency and severity of natural disturbances such as drought. Smallholder farmers are particularly exposed to the risks of climate change. Thus, identifying resilience-building practices and quantifying their effects can guide management in agro-ecological systems. Community-driven tree planting for carbon credits is a growing program in the Mount Kenya region of Kenya. Tree planting and agroforestry are known to have ecological benefits that improve soil quality, microclimate, and water retention, as well as economic benefits to farmers. To evaluate the benefits of these practices on resilience to drought, remotely sensed vegetation greenness (NDVI) was used to assess the state of the agro-ecological systems around Mt. Kenya during and after droughts within the last decade. Droughts were identified by the Kenyan government based on surveys of community members and remotely sensed data. Resilience was estimated using the rate term of a fit exponential curve to the vegetation recovery after a drought. The resilience estimation method was successful and found proven patterns of resilience with precipitation and landcover. Planted tree groves and immediate neighboring pixels have higher resilience to drought events than comparable pixels in the area, and they see less decrease in resilience to subsequent drought events than other pixels. Agroforestry programs are thus an important tool for building resilience to drought for smallholder farmers in Kenya who are increasingly threatened by climate change.
