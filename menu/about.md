I studied biomedical engineering in my undergrad because it felt like the most direct way to use my skills to improve people's lives. I worked for two years in the medical device industry on life-sustaining pacemakers, yet I found that it felt almost pointless in the face of the biggest threat to humanity and the world today: climate change. I am finishing my master's at the University of Exeter (Exeter, UK) in Global Sustainability Solutions this summer. As I entered a totally new academic field, friends and family were asking what exactly I learning every day. I decided to write these posts as a way to share what I was learning on a topic that is often underrepresented, misrepresented, and politicized in mainstream media.

I am a recipient of a US-UK Fulbright Grant to undertake this degree, and thus I will say: The views I express on this blog are entirely my own and not representative of the Fulbright Program, US Government, or any of their partners.
